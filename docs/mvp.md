    - Needed Stripe.js functions are exposed via a native Elm module.
  - Further Stripe integration needs some server code. Not part of first version's deliverables.

    - The server returns content keys to the client.
    - The server may also handle recurring charges by returning a customer id.
    - Communication via HTTP and/or Firebase
